# Deep-Convolutional-GAN-DCGAN-architecture-for-MNIST-dataset
Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN) architecture for MNIST dataset employs convolutional layers in both generator and discriminator networks. Generator upscales random noise to realistic digit images, while discriminator distinguishes between generated and real images. DCGAN ensures stable training, generating high-quality digit images.
